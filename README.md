# CS_GameEngine
The CS_GameEngine is a light weight game engine designed for those who like to create games without using a user interface.

## Getting Started
Clone or download a copy of the source code to your computer then open the GameEngine.sln in visual studio 17.

### Prerequisites

#### Visual Studio 17
Visual Studio is used to open the project files and modify, add or remove code from games and the engine.

##### Installing
Visual Studio 17 can be installed by going to the [official website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

#### .NET Framework 4.6
The .NET Framework is a group of code that makes it easier to program (Stops you from repeating, for example redefining common functions) CS_GameEngine uses the .Net Framework to optimise, easily create and manage windows and objects for your games.

##### Installing
Installing the .NET Framework is as easy as launching the visual studio installer (after you've installed it) from the start menu, press "modify", ticking the .NET Framework 4.6 and then pressing the install button on the right.

### Testing your game
To test your game make sure the solution configuration is set to your game (if not you can change this at the top of the window), make sure that it says debug and then press the green triangle with start next to it.
